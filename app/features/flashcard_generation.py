A good nightâ€™s sleep helps improve memory, learning, and decision-making. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining physical health by supporting immune function and regulating metabolism.

Lack of sleep has been linked to various health problems, including an increased risk of heart disease, obesity, and depression. Experts recommend that adults get between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help improve sleep quality.

Caffeine and heavy meals before bed can interfere with sleep, making it harder to fall and stay asleep. Additionally, exposure to natural sunlight during the day can help regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle, promoting better sleep at night.
